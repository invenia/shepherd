Stacks
=========

Stacks in shepherd handle management of collection of :ref:`Resources`. These management tasks range from using a :ref:`Config` to configure and parse the :ref:`Manifests` into :ref:`Resources`, to saving and restoring existing Stacks from :ref:`Storage`. Similarly, stacks provide a large number of useful methods for selecting subsets of :ref:`Resources`.

More specifics on methods provided by stacks can be found in the API docs.
